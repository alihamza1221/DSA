## Problem Description
Given a list of strings, the task is to find the maximum length of a concatenated string, where the concatenated string does not contain any repeated characters. The input strings may have duplicate characters, and the goal is to maximize the length of the concatenated string.

## Approach
1. Initialize the result (`res`) to include the case of an empty string "".
2. The `res` will include all possible combinations found during the iteration of the input strings.
3. Iterate through the input strings, skipping words that have duplicate characters. Note that duplicate characters within a single string are allowed.
4. For each string, check if it conflicts with any existing combination found so far. If there is an intersection of characters, skip it.
5. If there is no conflict, append the new combination to the result.
6. Return the maximum length from all the combinations.

## Example
Consider the example where input strings are processed for maximum length:
